## Git clone this repo using https

Assuming you have the latest stable version of node.js, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

because you should usually do so
### `npm install json-server`

install this package to run the server, which will default to localhost:3000/data

### `json-server --watch Equinox_FE_exercises.json`

to run the server
### `npm start`

will indicate that something is already running on port 3000 because something is: the json-server. type 'y' and the port will move to locahost:3001. Then you're good to go!
